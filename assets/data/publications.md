## Optimizing Data Lake Architecture for Analytics Workloads
Published in Modern Data Engineering Journal, 2023

This comprehensive guide explores strategies for designing efficient data lake architectures that support both batch and real-time analytics workloads. Drawing from my experience implementing large-scale data lakes on AWS, I discuss partitioning strategies, data cataloging best practices, and query optimization techniques that significantly reduce costs while improving performance.

## Building Scalable Data Pipelines: Lessons from the Trenches
From Data Engineering Summit 2023

In this conference presentation, I shared practical lessons learned from designing and implementing data pipelines that process billions of daily events. The article covers strategies for handling backpressure, implementing exactly-once semantics, and monitoring techniques that ensure pipeline reliability even during unexpected traffic spikes.

## Data Quality Monitoring at Scale: A Practical Framework
Technical blog series, 2023

This in-depth series explores the implementation of an automated data quality framework that continuously monitors critical datasets. I explain the architecture, metrics selection process, and alerting mechanisms that enable teams to detect and resolve data issues before they impact downstream analytics or machine learning systems.

## Event-Driven Architecture for Modern Data Engineering
AWS Community Publication, 2022

This article explores how event-driven architecture (EDA) can transform data engineering workflows. Drawing from real-world implementations, I discuss patterns for building loosely coupled, resilient data systems that adapt quickly to changing business requirements while maintaining data consistency and reliability.
